# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution


### What I learned
While working on the QR Trial project, I learned quite a bit about responsive web design and front-end development. This project allowed me to create a mobile and a desktop version of my HTML, ensuring a consistent user experience across several devices. Following the style guide, I practiced using the Outfit font family and accurate color inclusion. In addition, I improved my abilities in efficiently organizing HTML material and styling components with CSS. The mix of layout concerns, color schemes, and typography decisions proved the value of following a consistent design language. Overall, this project provided a useful practice exercise to improve my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web pages while adhering to set style rules.

### Continued development

For future development projects I need to foucs more on the Styling guides and learn more about CSS and JavaScript to make the webpage more informational, attractive, and responsive for the user.
